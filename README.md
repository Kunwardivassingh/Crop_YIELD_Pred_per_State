# Crop_YIELD_Pred_per_State
This project predicts Indian state crop yields using machine learning, analyzing weather, soil, and crop data. It preprocesses data, trains models like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, evaluates with MAE, R-squared, optimizing agricultural practices for sustainability and food security.

 Key highlights:

Overview: Brief project introduction and objectives.

Data Collection: Sources and cleaning steps.

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature engineering, normalization.

EDA: Understanding data distributions and trends.

Model Training: Techniques and algorithms used.

Model Evaluation: Metrics like MAE, R-squared.
